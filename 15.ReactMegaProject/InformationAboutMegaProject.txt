Step1<><><><><>

First we will analyse that which tools we are going to use like in our blog project we will use Appwrite as a backemd and react Hook Form for forms, react routers,Redux toolkit,tinymce,Html react parser etc. and
then we will install them using npm following commands:

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-router-dom appwrite @tinymce/tinymce-react html-react-parser react-hook-form

step2<><><><><>
we have to provide some variable as sperate file beacause we dono want that nayone can access these variables. and when we are going to deploy our project we have to uplpad these variables as a seperete file.
that file is created as name of only  .env in the root directory of the project. and we donot upload this file to github or any other platform.we have to pass that file into gitignore.
